        MiamiCoin ($MIA) has the potential to help Miami become the next tech
        hub...
      </h3>
      <p>
        Talent and capital have often been cited as barriers to Miami's growth
        as the next tech hub. To become the next tech hub, Miami needs to
        attract and retain more tech talent in the city. Startups and tech
        workers are attracted to investment potential and innovation networks.
      </p>

      <p>
        MiamiCoinâ€™s contributions to the city's treasury have grown to millions
        of dollars in just a few months, and Mayor Suarez and the City of Miami
        Commission have proposed several uses for the funds, including crypto
        education and incentives for tech entrepreneurs.
      </p>
