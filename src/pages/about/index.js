      <h3>
        MiamiCoin ($MIA) has the potential to help Miami become the next tech
        hub...
      </h3>
      <p>
        Talent and capital have often been cited as barriers to Miami's growth
        as the next tech hub. To become the next tech hub, Miami needs to
        attract and retain more tech talent in the city.
      </p>

      <p>
        Startups and tech workers are attracted to investment potential and
        innovation networks.
      </p>

      <p>
        MiamiCoinâ€™s contributions to the city's treasury have grown to tens of
        millions of dollars in just a few months
      </p>

      <p>
        Mayor Suarez and the City of Miami Commission have proposed several uses
        for the funds, including crypto education and incentives for tech
        entrepreneurs.
      </p>

      <h3>Enter MiamiStarter...</h3>
      <p>
        Miamistarter is a Web 3.0 app that allows $MIA token holders to vote on
        and/or invest in innovative crypto and tech startups based in Miami.
      </p>
      <p>
        MiamiStarter helps the city put the funds it receives via $MIA mining to
        attract crypto founders and other tech entrepreneurs to Miami, thereby
        growing Miami's tech ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, by requiring $MIA tokens to participate in the voting process,
        MiamiStarter creates an incentive for people to hold $MIA, thereby
        contributing to $MIA adoption in the city.
